## These are not the codes you are looking for.

CouchApp development has moved to an official project repository.

[http://github.com/couchapp/couchapp](http://github.com/couchapp/couchapp)

Please ignore jchris/couchapp and look to couchapp/couchapp for the real code.

You might try just installing via `sudo easy_install couchapp` if you aren't interested in writing patches to CouchApp itself.

Cheers,
Chris
